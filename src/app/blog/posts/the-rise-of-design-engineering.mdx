What if I offered you a job? Hypothetically, of course. I will give you the conditions it entails as well. You are going to have to wake up the first and will get to sleep the last. Oh, and you will have to work every single day through the year without any weekly holidays. That's right, no holidays at all. And regarding your queries during the festivals, you will be given a fair amount of additional work during the festive time. Yes, also, you could be called any second throughout your contract to attend or assist in one of your assignments, which could range from preparing a chart on 'The Sub-Atomic particles' to waking up in the middle of the night to feed your infant. 
So, you really won't be getting a proper healthy lifestyle. We also do not entertain resignation either. Oh, of course, the last and main condition, you will not be paid any salary at all. So, will you take up the job? Do give it a thought.

## What an absurd offer?

Who would even accept such a job, right?

Wrong.
There are currently billions across the world performing the exact same job, with a passion. And all of them are mothers, women. So, I am pretty sure that those of you who actually gave it a thought, are definitely women.

Feminism, whenever we hear the word, we usually ignore and dismiss the notion. We assume it is pretty obvious that in the current modern environment we live in, equal opportunities for women are obviously available. And that such a concept is to be brought to light in some remote villages where people still believe in backward systems, which endanger the livelihood of women. But, just take a moment and think about it, observe your daily surroundings. 

I started to observe my regular life and the lifestyle of the people around me. Ours is a typical nuclear family. I observed that my mom would be awake before everyone else; she never had to fix an alarm. She would just wake up, magically. Not once could any of the rest of us master that skill. She would prepare breakfast for all of us, then me and my sister would leave for school and my dad for his work. My mom has a degree in Mathematics and Computer Technologies. She even had a job, a well paid job which she very much liked but had to quit after her marriage. 
By the time we came home, lunch would be ready, always fresh and hot. Next, around only two hours after lunch, she would have to start working on dinner. We would eat supper together, and my mom was always the last to fall asleep. I never once saw my dad helping my mom while preparing meals, but he would always compliment her cooking. It was not always like that; what changed?

It was two years ago, some misunderstanding between my dad and his co-workers was driving him up the wall. He was extremely irritated so he had let off some steam, which unfortunately happened to be on the morning meal. He was screaming profanities at my mom because the breakfast was the same as yesterday's. Their argument was pointless but ended with the breakfast thrown across the floor. My mom was furious and she showed it by giving him 'the silent treatment'. Later that day, she prepared dinner for him and left it on the dining table, but my dad did not eat it. He instead ordered from outside for the next two days. On the third day, he woke up with food poisoning. Hence, he finally faced that he could not go on like this. But he was a great man, and with a great man comes a great dignity. So what if he was a man, its not like he can not survive without my mom. Thus, he resorted to cooking the basic Indian Dosa, which turned out to be anything but circles; Ameoba would have been proud. While at the breakfast table that day, I and my sister were devouring my mom's best pasta, and my dad was stuck with half burnt and half raw 'Dosas.' 
Through the next few days, he was no where near improvement in his cooking skills. So, during one of the following evenings, he swallowed his dignity, walked up to my mom, and asked if she could serve some fries. That was all; no apologies were exchanged, but both of them knew he was expressing his regret. Since that day, he did not once forget to compliment my mom on her dishes. There were moments when we would be dining in a restaurant, but he would automatically praise the course, and it always ended with a hearty laugh.

I get that there are numerous feminist influencers all around the world, such as Gloria Steinem, Malala Yousaf, and Emma Watson. But that does not stop me from wanting my mom to pursue her career. It does not have to be protesting against major anti-feministic practices worldwide, but just a small gesture that makes a difference. It is not about proving that females are better than males; it is about sending the message that the world is not made of women and men but of human beings.
