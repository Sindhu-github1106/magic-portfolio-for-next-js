College wasn’t supposed to be this hard. When I entered my second year, I thought I had it all figured out. First year had its hiccups, sure, but I thought the toughest part was over. I was wrong. This year hit me like a wave. The workload doubled, and somehow, my energy halved. Lectures blurred into each other. Assignments piled up. I found myself staring at my laptop at 2 a.m., wondering how I ended up so behind. Everyone around me seemed to be doing fine, and that made it worse. I started doubting myself—wondering if I even belonged here.

## Reflecting on the Journey So Far

There were days I didn’t want to leave my bed. Days I’d skip meals just to catch up on readings or crash early out of exhaustion. What made it harder was pretending everything was okay. Smiling through group projects, saying “I’m good” when asked how I was doing. But then, something shifted.

## The Challenges That Shaped Me

One night, after breaking down over a missed deadline, I called a close friend. I don’t even remember what I said, but they listened. Really listened. And that was the first time I felt like I wasn’t alone in this. Slowly, I started opening up more—talking to classmates, reaching out to professors, even booking time with a campus counselor.

## Gratitude and Acknowledgment

Things didn’t magically get easier, but I started learning how to ask for help. I started forgiving myself for not being perfect. I realized struggling doesn’t mean you’re weak—it means you’re human. And that’s okay.

## Looking Ahead

College is still hard. But now, I know I’m not facing it alone. And that has made all the difference.

Thank you for being part of this journey with me, and here’s to the adventures yet to come!
