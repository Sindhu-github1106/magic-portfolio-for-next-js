If I had a bird for every bug I encountered, I’d have an aviary by now.

What started as a simple idea—“Hey, let’s make an Angry Birds clone in Java with LibGDX!”—quickly spiraled into a full-blown emotional rollercoaster. One day I’m launching birds like a coding god; the next, my bird disappears into the void like it just rage-quit reality.

## The Highs

The first successful slingshot launch felt like winning a mini-Oscar. I actually fist-pumped the air. Seeing the physics engine actually work after tweaking Box2D for hours gave me a sense of power no caffeine could replicate. Watching pigs explode in glorious 2D chaos was disturbingly satisfying. Maybe too satisfying. When everything worked (which was rare), I felt like the lovechild of Elon Musk and a Red Angry Bird.

## The Lows

Debugging collision detection was like trying to argue with a stubborn toddler—except the toddler is your code and it has no remorse. The bird sometimes turned into a yoga-master mid-air, stretching into infinity. RIP, float values. One time I rotated the slingshot... and the entire game world rotated with it. That was humbling. And don’t even get me started on asset scaling. Why is my pig 20ft tall!?

## What I Learned

Game dev is 95% problem-solving, 4% Googling StackOverflow, and 1% actually coding. Nothing teaches patience like tuning physics bodies that refuse to behave. It’s okay to take breaks, laugh at your failures, and maybe threaten your IDE with uninstalling (lovingly, of course).

In the end, this Angry Birds project taught me way more than just game dev. It taught me resilience, creativity, and that sometimes, birds need to crash before they can soar.
